                                <p>Through hard work, perseverance, and dedication. I was able to reach an upper management position in the restaurant industry.</p>
                                <p>Now I strive to replicate my success in web development. In my time in the customer service industry Iâ€™ve learned a lot, and I believe my experience in problem solving,
                                     making creative decisions and the ability to work and communicate with any type of person, translate very well to the world of programming.</p>
                                <p>I have always had an interest and passion for technology and chose to go to Centriq to turn my passion into a career that is challenging but rewarding. Programming intrigued me because I love the prospect of building something I can be proud of and working with a team to solve problems or create new ideas. When you hire me, you are hiring someone who is passionate and dedicated to his craft, with the desire and ability to learn new things and will be a valuable asset to your team</p>
